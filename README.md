<ins>Impact</ins>: I utilized Tableau visualization to empower ESD Coordinators by presenting insights derived from survey responses focused on parental involvement within schools. Through detailed analysis, I paired the survey data with additional variables, such as demographic information or student performance metrics, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. By transforming complex data into clear, actionable visualizations, I enabled coordinators to identify trends, address challenges, and make data-informed decisions effectively.

This process not only streamlined communication but also highlighted key areas for improvement, fostering a collaborative approach to enhancing parent-school engagement. The ability to present data in an accessible and meaningful way ensured that stakeholders could confidently prioritize strategies that would have the greatest impact on educational outcomes.
